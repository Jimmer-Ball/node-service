node-service
============

Node.js and MongoDB on the server side, and backbone stack (backbone, underscore, JQuery, etc) on 
the client side, with sample Jasmine tests for client side and Node.js server side.

Still need to decide on the module framework, so CommonJS or RequireJS, and am probably going to go
for RequireJS, meaning I'll need to amend how Node.js works its modules.
