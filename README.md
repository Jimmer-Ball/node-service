node-service
============

Node.js and MongoDB on the server side, and backbone stack (backbone, underscore, JQuery, etc) on 
the client side, with sample Jasmine tests for client side and Node.js server side.

Module structure on both the client and server side is to be RequireJS.  Done the client side 
including tests, and need to apply RequireJS on Node now.
